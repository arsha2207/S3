## JAVA LAB

1. Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, 
   Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes
   'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 
   'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer
   and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.[click here](java_lab/display_employ.java)
2. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ). 
   Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape.
   Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the given 
   geometrical structures.[click here](java_lab/ShapeMain.java)
3. Write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer.[click here](java_lab/file.java)
4. Write a Java program that read from a file and write to file by handling all file related exceptions.[click here](java_lab/filecpy.java)
5. Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers[click here](java_lab/strtoken.java)
6. Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, throws and finally.[click here](java_lab/exception.java)
7. Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First thread generates a
   random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, second thread computes the square of the number and prints. 
   If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.[click here](java_lab/random.java)
8. Write a Java program that shows thread synchronization.[click here](java_lab/evenodd.java)
9. Write a Java program for the following:[click here](java_lab/dl.java)

    2) Delete a given element from the above list.
    3) Display the contents of the list after deletion. 
10. Write a Java program that implements the binary search algorithm.[click here](java_lab/sort.java)
11. Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.[click here](java_lab/Palindrome.java)
12. Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices.[click here](java_lab/MatrixMultiply.java)

2)Implement a queue using linked list with the following operations: 1.enqueue 2.dequeue 3.display
      
       file name: lLqueue.c

3)Write a program to read two polynomials and store them using linked list. Calculate the product of the two
 polynomials and display the first polynomial, second polynomial and the resultant polynomial.
 

	file name: lLpolymulti.c

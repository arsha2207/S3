##S3 Lab

This repositary contains the programs I have done in java and data structure lab in Btech s3.

#DS LAB


1)Write a menu driven program for performing the following operations on a linked list
	1. Display
	2. Insert at beginning
	3. Insert at end
	4. Insert at a specified position
	5. Delete from beginning
	6. Delete from end
	7. Delete from a specified position

	file name:[linked list.c](linked list.c)


2)Implement a queue using linked list with the following operations: 1.enqueue 2.dequeue 3.display
      
       file name: lLqueue.c

3)Write a program to read two polynomials and store them using linked list. Calculate the product of the two
 polynomials and display the first polynomial, second polynomial and the resultant polynomial.
 

	file name: lLpolymulti.c


4)Create a binary tree with the following operations
	1. Insert a new node
	2. Inorder traversal
	3. Preorder traversal
	4. Postorder traversal
	5. Delete a node	

	file name: bt.c

5)Write a program to create a binary search tree (data items are integers) with the following operations
	1. Insert a new node
	2. Inorder traversal
	3. Preorder traversal
	4. Postorder traversal
	5. Delete a node
	6. Find the number of leaf nodes
	7. Sort the input numbers

	file name: bst.c

6)Represent any given graph and perform depth first search and breadth first search.

	file name: graph.c

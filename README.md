   + Insert elements into the queue
   + Delete elements from the queue
   + Display the contents of the queue after each operation 
7. Implement a Priority Queue using arrays with the operations: [click here](ds_lab/prique.c)
   + Insert elements into the queue
   + Delete elements from the queue
   + Display the contents of the queue after each operation 
8. Implement a Double Ended Queue using arrays with the operations: [click here](ds_lab/doubleque.c)
     + Insert elements into the queue (both front and rear)
     + Delete elements from the queue (both front and rear)
     + Display the contents of the queue after each operation 
9. Write a menu driven program for performing the following operations on a linked list [click here](ds_lab/linked_list.c)
   1. Display
   2. Insert at beginning
   3. Insert at end
   4. Insert at a specified position
   5. Delete from beginning
   6. Delete from end
   7. Delete from a specified position


10. Create a doubly linked list from a string taking each character from the string. Check if the string is palindrome in a efficient method. [click here](ds_lab/dLpallindrome.c)
11. Implement a stack using linked list with the operations: [click here](ds_lab/Llstack.c)
    1. Push
